# QuizMakerapp
### So I have created a App where you can login and or signup and create your own quizzes and give them (like flashcards) 
### So for this project I have used Node.js and Postgresql for backend.
### To start/use the project you will need to create a database of name quiz inside postgresql. Copy and paste the required SQL into your pgAdmin
### You will need to add the following line of code into the terminal : npm i express ejs pg body-parser 
### To start the program : node server.js 
### Go to the following http://localhost:3000/
